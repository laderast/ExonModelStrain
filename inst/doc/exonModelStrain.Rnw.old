\title{ExonStrainModel: simple linear modeling to detect exon-specific strain 
differences in Affymetrix Exon Array data}

\section{Introduction}

The package \Rpackage{ExonStrainModel} applies two linear models to Affymetrix Exon 
Array data in order to detect exon-specific differences in expression between two 
strains.  Currently, only Mouse Exon Array 1.0 core probesets are supported.

The first linear model applies to multiple-exon transcripts.  For a given transcript 
or gene, we fit the following linear model:


Expression \= Strain + Exon + Subject\%in\%Strain + Exon\:Strain


Note the Exon:Strain interaction term.  For a single exon, the model reduces to:


Expression \= Strain + Subject\%in\%Strain


\Rpackage{ExonStrainModel} applies ANOVA to the fit linear models in an attempt to
detect differential alternative splicing between strains.  In the case of a multiple-exon
transcript, we are interested in finding significant p-values for the interaction term
Exon\:Strain.  In this case, expression is significantly different between the two
strains for one or more exons.

\Rpackage{ExonStrainModel} also provides tools and metrics based on the Expression Data
that allow for filtering and stratification such as the position of the exon with
the largest expression difference between strains as well as visualization of the 
interaction plots between the two strains.

\section{Implementation Details}

In order to achieve this, an Ensembl-Exon Array mapping (\Rpackage{mouseexonensembl.db}) 
was built, mapping Ensembl Transcript IDs, Gene IDs, and Exon IDs to probeset 
boundaries.  A probeset was mapped to a particular entity (exon, transcript, etc) 
if either the start or end of that probeset was within the boundary of that entity.  
Note that the mapping is many-to-many: that is, a probeset may be a member of 
multiple exons, due to transcriptional structure (for example, two separate 
transcripts belonging to a gene may contain slightly different but overlapping 
exons).

Note this approach is similar to that taken by the \Rpackage{exonmap} project.
However, our database package differs in that we only map exonic (not intronic)
regions, and in implementation (we use a SQLite based database rather than a MySQL
based database).


\section{Preprocessing Exon Array Data}

\Rpackage{ExonStrainModel} uses as input an ExpressionSet and a list of 
Ensembl Transcript or Gene IDs to do the analysis.  It also requires a phenoData
object that contains a column called table.

Exon Array CEL files can be loaded by \Rfunction{ReadAffy}, Normalized and Summarized using 
current Bioconductor tools (use of the annotation packages available at 
\url{http://xmap.picr.man.ac.uk/download/} are recommended.  We do recommend SNP masking
any SNPs that are different between the two strains.  For large datasets and computers 
with limited memory, use of the \Rpackage{aroma.affymetrix} is suggested.

The following script will preprocess, normalize, SNP mask and produce probeset-level 
summaries for a set of CEL files in the current working directory. 

(Note that the \Rfunction{ReadExon} function from the \Rpackage{exonmap} could also be used as well, 
provided that an annotation file called {\it covdesc} exists in the working directory.  This
file should be a space delimited file with a line for each array, and a column called strain
where each sample is labeled either 1 or 2. For more details, please refer to \Rpackage{exonmap}.)

<<eval=FALSE>>=
library(mouseexonpmcdf)
library(mouseexonensembl.db)
library(affy)

#Read CEL files in current working directory
raw.data <- ReadAffy()
#change cdf filename
raw.data@cdfName <- "mouseexonpmcdf"

abatch1 <- bg.correct.rma(raw.data)
abatch2 <- normalize.AffyBatch.quantiles(abatch1)

#masking function
mask3 <- function(x, maskfile="b6vsd2snpmask.txt"){
   mask <- read.csv(maskfile)
   probes <- mask[,2]
   intensity(x)[probes,] <- NA
   return(x)
}

abatch3 <- mask3(abatch2)

eset <- computeExprSet(abatch3, pmcorrect="pmonly",
      summary.method="medianpolish", 
      summary.param=list(na.rm=TRUE))

library(convert)
eset <- as(eset, "ExpressionSet")

coreprobesets <- getCoreProbesets()

eset <- eset[coreprobesets,]
@

\section{Attaching phenoData to the ExpressionSet} 

To this data file, we need to attach an appropriate phenoData file.  This file is 
an annotation file where each sample is represented and the strain is annotated.  This 
annotation file called {\it covdesc} should exists in the working directory.  This
file should be a space delimited file with a line for each array, and a column called strain
where each sample is labeled either 1 or 2. For more details, please refer to \Rpackage{exonmap}.)

<<eval=FALSE>>=
pData <- read.delim("covdesc")

phen <- new("AnnotatedDataFrame", data = pData)

phenoData(eset) <- phen
@

Alternatively, we can also build a data frame directly in R, based on the sample names.  
For example, say the first ten samples correspond to strain 1 and the next 10 samples 
correspond to strain 2.

<<eval=FALSE>>=
n <- sampleNames(eset)
#equivalent to c(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2)
Strain <- c(rep(1,10), rep(2,10))

names(Strain) <- n
pData <- as.data.frame(Strain)

phen <- new("AnnotatedDataFrame", data = pData)

phenoData(eset) <- phen
@

\section{Analysing the Expression Set for Differential Exon Expression}

Now that we have an appropriate ExpressionSet, the Core Expression probesets can now be analysed for 
differential exon expression using \Rfunction{RunExonModelWorkflow}.

First we examine the list of Transcript IDs.

<<results=hide>>=
library(ExonModelStrain)
@

<<eval=TRUE>>=
# Loads a small example ExpressionSet (TestDataTrans)
# And a small list of Transcript IDs (testTrans)
load("exontestdata.RData")
testTrans
@

Now we run the model on the 20 transcripts.  \Rfunction{RunExonStrainModel} is smart enough to know
to run the single-exon model on single-exon transcripts, and the multiple-exon model on multiple-exon
transcripts.

<<eval=TRUE>>=
results <- RunExonModelWorkflow(TestSetTrans, testTrans, 
      dBPackage="mouseexonensembl.db")
#9 out of the 20 transcripts are multiple-exon transcripts
multres <- results$multi
multres
@

We can also look at the single exon results.

<<eval=TRUE>>=
#no single-exon results in test set
sing <- results$singles
sing
@

Finally, we can get a list of those transcripts that were not modeled.  These 
transcripts may not have the representative probesets that exist in our data.

\section{Adjusting for Multiple Comparisons}

A convenience function, \Rfunction{RunQVals} is provided to adjust the p-values for 
multiple comparison.  \Rfunction{RunQVals} utilizes the \Rpackage{qvalue} in order
to adjust the p-values for False Discovery Rate (FDR).  In our example, qvalue
cannot estimate the pi0 term of the raw Exon p-values and thus returns a null
column for the qvalues.

<<eval=TRUE>>=
multqv <- RunQVals(multres)
multqv
@

\section{Filtering the Result Sets}

Say we are interested in finding Strain-specific Exon interactions.  We can find possible 
interactions by filtering our resulting dataframe.

<<eval=TRUE>>=
attach(multqv)
sig <- multqv[qExonStrain<0.05,]
detach(multqv)
sig
@

Here we see two transcripts with significant exon/strain interaction terms.

There are other flags that exist in the resulting data frame that can be used to further stratify/filter
the data. For example, \Rfunction{multprobeflag} is a flag that indicates whether there is at least one exon 
in the transcript that has multiple mapped probesets.  \Rfunction{missingexonflag} indicates whether
there are exons in the transcript that are not mapped to the data.  \Rfunction{MissingExons} will return
a list of exons not currently mapped to the data.

For more details, refer to \Rfunction{RunExonModelWorkflow}.

\section{Plotting the Result Sets}

We have two possible transcripts with exon/strain interactions.  We should now examine the 
interaction plots to see whether these exon specific differences.

Note that these plots may not be representative of all exons in a transcript.  That is,
if no probesets exist in the ExpressionSet that map to an exon, that exon is not
represented in the graph.  To get a list of missing exons for a transcript, please refer to
\Rfunction{MissingExons}.

There are two ways to plot these results.  The first is to plot by id.

<<eval=FALSE>>=
PlotExon("ENSMUST00000079776", ExpSet=TestSetTrans)
@

\includegraphics{example.png}

Note the large expression difference between the two strains at Exon ENMUSE00000125970.

Or, if we have a large number of significant results, we can save the plots in the working directory
for later examination.  These plots are named automatically, by gene symbol + ID (for example, 

<<eval=TRUE>>=
PlotExonResults(sig, ExpSet=TestSetTrans, savePlot=TRUE)
